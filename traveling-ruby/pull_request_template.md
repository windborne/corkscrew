# Pull Request template

Please consider the following when creating a Pull Request (yay!):

### Reference an issue or milestone
Describe the big picture of your changes here to communicate to the maintainers why we should accept this pull request. If it fixes a bug or resolves a feature request, be sure to link to that issue.

You can bring up a list of suggested issues and pull requests within the repository by typing #. Type the issue or pull request number or title to filter the list, and then press either tab or enter to complete the highlighted result.

### Write a description of changes made
Provide a description of the changes proposed. Make sure to answer what types of changes your code introduces:
- Bugfix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)
- New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)
- Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)

__BONUS POINTS__
- Check if the commit's or even all commits' message styles matches ours.
- Extend the repo's README / documentation, if applicable.

### Avoid breakage
- Pull requests should normally be submitted against the latest stable branch (e.g. main).
- Elaborate how you've tested your code.
- If this is a relatively large or complex change, kick off the discussion by explaining why you chose the solution you did and what alternatives you considered, etc...
