# Issue Template

When filing a bug report, please ensure that you include the following information:
- What steps will reproduce the problem?
- What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
- What does your environment looks like (operating system, language, configuration, infrastructure)

__BONUS POINTS__
- Include files that provide context to the issue you're experiencing, like screenshots. For logs however, please create a GIST which is a paste of your full logs, and link that. Do NOT paste your full logs in issues, as that will make them very long and hard to read.
- If your project is public, link to the repo so we can investigate directly.

### Checklist
Before submitting your issue, please consider the following:
- Avoid using GitHub issues for questions or help. Submitting issues to this repository are reserved for bugs, feature requests, or changes to the source code.
- Check if the issue is not already reported. If you're experiencing an issue someone else has already reported, please add a comment to the existing issue so we can properly assess the gravity of the problem.
- Use labels appropriately (no more than 2 per issue).
